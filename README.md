# "Signal" Password Manager **[WIP]**

Signal Password Manager is a terminal based (Hoping to oneday make it GUI based) password manager that relies on the ChaCha20 cryptographic cipher to encrypt your passwords. This is currently a work in progress file.

As this is a personal project, use it at your own risk and understand that I cannot claim responisiblity for issues that occur. I am open to all feedback; in fact I would really like feedback.

## To-Do
+ ~~Add option to add new databases apart from just having one~~
+ ~~Fix the program asking to enter a password twice for a database that already exists~~
+ ~~Create and "if error -> password incorrect" i.e. error handling~~
+ ~~Organise my code into many different files.~~
